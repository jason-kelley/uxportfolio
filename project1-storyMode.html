            <h1>Defining our sprint</h1>
            <p>Using the project goal as our lead, we brainstormed many big ideas for possible directions we could take. One example was an app that pairs local farms with restaurants needing a way to offload their compost ( a recent law passed in Austin
              made this a requirement for restaurants). Although focused on one of our users, it ignored the other and didn't meet our project requirements.

        <main role="main" class="inner cover my-auto">
          <div class="wow fadeIn">

            <p>We also conceptualized a feature that took a volunteer approach into consideration which was inspired by my conversation with Russell from Keep Austin Fed. The idea was to be the Uber of volunteer services by connecting Good Samaritans to donors who are unable to deliver food to a charity. Although the team was driven with this direction, ultimately we had to abandon it and focus on our most important features. This was an important teachable moment for our team.</p>

            <p class="lead">Because we were utilizing the scrum method, and had two weeks to produce a minimum viable product (MVP), we re-centered our attention on what exactly we were trying to deliver and for whom.

            <p>Because we established the donor would snap a picture of her donation, we knew early on that we were designing for mobile. This provided parameters that eventually benefitted us: it forced us to minimize the clutter and highlight the information that is most useful.</p>
